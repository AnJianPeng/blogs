CAP Theroem
Dynamo is a leaderless AP distributed key-value store, providing eventual consistency. 
Driven by the key requirements
1. Simple primary-key only get/put interface is sufficient for most Amazon applications. 
    * No fancy relational database feature is needed.
    * No cross-item operations.
2. Failures in hundreds of machines are common.
2. High availablity is significant for Aamazon business. Dynamo should be always available for write.
3. Support team-level configure to meet individual teams' own SLAs.
    * Amazon services provide SLAs at 99.9 percentile instead of median, since user experience is impacted most at high-end.
4. Need pluggable persistence engine for different item size.
5. Dynamo's operational environment is non-hostile.

Interfaces
`get(key) => a single object or objects with conflicting versions + *context*`
`put(key, context, object) => Determine the replicas of the related *key*, and writes the replicas`


## Design Consideration
| Questions | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| Consistency VS. Availability | Requirement #2 choose **Availability** and **Eventual Consistency** |
| Eventual Consistency | Quorum |
| Conflict resolution during writes/reads | Requirement #2 choose resolution at reads for write availability |
| Who performs conflict resolution | Configurable: <br>1. Last write wins<br>2. Application side resolution |
| Partitioning | Consistent hash + Virtual Nodes |
| Replication | N replicas in N consistent hash virtual nodes |
| Data Versioning | Version vector + Appliation side resolution at reads |
| Failures | Hinted Handoff |
| Perimant Failures | Anti-entropy replica synchronization => Eventual Consistency |
| Membership and failure dection | Gossip-based protocol, not some ways like Zookeeper |
| Reads find stale replica | Read Repair => Eventual Consistency|

## Steps in Writes/Reads
