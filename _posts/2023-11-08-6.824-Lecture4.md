# Primary-Backup Replication
## Failures
It is for fault tolerance on failures (fail-stop faults).
Not for bugs
Disaters in a region
Manufacturing faults


## Replication Approaches
### State Transfer
State - RAM content

### Replicated State Machine
External events/operations
primary could be ahead of backup

What state? 
All low level details in a machine, fault-tolerance for arbitrary software, no need to understand business semantic

P/B sync
Cut-Over
Anomalies
New Replicas (when failure)

#### VMware FT
P/B see inputs, only P sends out outputs
Log Entry channel betwen P/B

## No-determistic events
Inputs - Packet - data + arrival interrupt
Weird instructions
Multi Core  

Log entry
    * Instruction #
    * Type
    * Data
